This site hosts a collection of fun Computational Thinking Challenges. Compete for fame, glory, or cookies!
<br><br>

The challenges are arranged into seasons. Season 1 challenges involve <a href="scratch.mit.edu" alt="link to MIT Scratch website">Scratch</a>, a block-based programming tool. Future seasons might involve other coding languages, or non-coding puzzles.
<br><br>

Challenges each have a difficulty rating. Each challenge includes hints and links to resources so that anyone can complete them, although people with more prior experience might be able to complete harder challenges more quickly.
<br><br>

Choose any challenges that look interesting, and submit your solutions to Mr. Delfino. Everyone who participates meaningfully will receive some sort of small reward (think: cookies).
