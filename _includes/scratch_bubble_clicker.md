Create a "Pop the Bubbles" clicker game in Scratch!

Your program should have the following features:
* A bubble moves across the screen, and bounces when it hits the edges.
* New bubbles spawn occasionally.
* Make bubbles disappear when they are clicked.
* Keep score - points should be scored every time a bubble is clicked.

Some extension ideas:
* Experiment with different ways to make new bubbles spawn - after a time interval, or when the original ball bounces, or when bubbles are popped.
* Make new bubbles spawn when the original bubble touches the edge, or make
* Spawn different types (colors) of bubbles, which move at different speeds and are worth different amounts points.
* Increase the speed of the bubbles over time, or as more bubbles are popped.
* Set a limit on the number of bubbles that can be alive at once, and stop the game if the limit is reached.
